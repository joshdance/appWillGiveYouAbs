	Hi. I'm Josh. Now the first thing you should probably ask yourself is, does the guy who made <a href="index.html">an app to get abs</a> actually have abs? The answer is sadly... not yet. But I am halfway there.
</div>
<div>
	These are the principles and research I did to go from 28% body fat to 20% body fat.

	(I don't have a picture in the gym at 20% bf. Yes I own more than one shirt, but I happened to wear the same one both days. 😁)
</div>
<div>I averaged about a 320 daily calorie deficit between these two pictures. Just eating less and working out more.
</div>

<div>
	I am currently working towards that 10% body fat goal and should get there by this summer. I will update this page with my progress, or you can follow along on my Instagram here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejoshdance/" target="_blank">📷Instagram📸📷</a>
