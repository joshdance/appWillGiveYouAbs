	<h2>How to estimate body fat percentage</h2>
	<p>5% body fat:¬†Ridiculously (dangerously) lean. All muscles, veins, and striations (the rod looking stripes on a muscle) are very visible. This is the lowest level of body fat you a human male have.</p>
	<p>6-8% body fat:¬†Extremely low levels of body fat. Think Hollywood Baywatch or Blade. This level is still very difficult to maintain and not easily sustainable. This level is characterized by muscle definition in most muscle groups and some clear vascularity (the showing of your veins) in areas such as arms, legs, and abs.</p>
	<p>10-12% body fat:¬†Very in shape. Your abs can be seen, but aren‚Äôt as deeply chiseled or defined as a man with 6-8% body fat. This is the body fat percentage that is the perfect beach body most people strive for. At this level there is still some defined veins in the arms and legs.</p>
	<p>15% body fat:¬†This percentage of body fat usually fits into the ‚Äúlean and fit‚Äù category. Outlines of muscle can be seen, but there is not really a clear separation between them. Muscles and veins can slightly be seen, but are covered by a thin layer of fat. However, the overall body shape is present and can be noticed.</p>
	<p>20% body fat:¬†Muscle definition is not as present and noticeable especially in the abdomen. A man with this level of body fat typically has the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù look and has a pouch on his abdomen.</p>
	<p>25% body fat:¬†There is almost no separation of muscles, no noticeable veins and no muscle striations. The man‚Äôs waist begins to increase and he may have a little neck fat. However, this man may not look like he has 25% body fat in normal clothing. 25% body fat for a man is considered obese, and men are creeping into the over a 40 inch waist, which is considered abdominal obesity.</p>
	<p>30% body fat:¬†More fat is present around the body at the 30% level including waist, back, thighs, and calves. The waist will appear slightly larger relative to the hips, and the man‚Äôs stomach will most-likely be protruding noticeably over the waist.</p>
	<p>35% body fat:¬†As men get heavier, their fat tends to go right to their stomach or gut. This percentage of body fat is more of the beer gut look. The waist circumference at this point can be about 40+ inches.</p>
	<p>40% body fat:¬†This percentage is very similar to the 35% level, yet there is more fat accumulation in the stomach and waist region. This is the point where basic daily activities become difficult such as walking up stairs or bending over to pick something up. At this body fat percentage you are considered morbidly obese.</p>

<h2>What is your goal?</h2>
<p>
	What is your goal body fat %? This is a better question that what is your goal weight.
</p>
<div>
	<input type="number" class="inputform" id="bfGoalInputBox" value="10">
</div>

<h2>Starting Point</h2>
<div>
	You currently weigh <span name="weightInsert">A</span>lbs. With your current body fat percentage of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span>% you have <span id="LbsBfResultsDiv">B</span> of body fat and <span id="leanResultsDiv"></span> lbs of lean body mass.
</div>

<div>You want to decrease your body fat, and keep your lean body mass.</div>
<div>To do that, you need to do </div>
<ol>
	<li>Be in an energy deficit.</li>
	<li>Lift weights.</li>
	<li>Eat enough protein to repair and build your muscles.</li>
	<li>Sleep enough to repair and build your muscles and keep you stress hormones down..</li>
</ol>

<div id="bfRunDown"></div>
<div>Let's tackle the first one.</div>

<h2>Energy Deficit</h2>
<div>This one is a simple concept, but difficult to do. You need to balance how much energy you consume, with home much energy you use.</div>
<div>The energy you use needs to be consistently greater than the energy you consume.</div>

<div>Let's first calculate how much energy you use on average. </div>

<div>Your body uses or burns energy all the time to keep you alive and happy. If you did absolutely nothing in a day, your body would still burn a lot of energy keeping you healthy.</div>
<div>This is called your base metabolic rate, or BMR.</div>

<h3>Let's Calculate your BMR</h3>

<p>
<div>
	What is your age?
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="age" id="age" value="33">
</div>
<div>
	What is your height in feet?
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="feet" id="feet" value="5">
	and your remaining height in inches
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="inches" id="inches" value="8">
</div>

<div>
	Let's use our weight, that you entered earlier, of <span name="weightInsert">weight fill</span>lbs.
</div>


<div>
	<button type="button" class="calcBmrButton squareButton" id="calcBmr">Calculate your BMR!</button>
</div>
<p></p>

<div>Your estimated BMR is <span id="bmrAnswer"></span></div>
<p></p>
<div>If you did nothing in a day, you body would burn that many calories keeping you alive. </div>
<div>
	However, we all do activites during the day. We multiple this BMR by an activity multipler to add in additional calories that we burn with our activity. 
</div>
<div>
<h3>Activity Multiplier</h3>
</div>
<div>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="sedentary" value="sedentary" checked>
<label for="sedentary">Sedentary 1.15</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="light" value="light">
<label for="light">Light Activity 1.35</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="moderate" value="moderate">
<label for="moderate">Moderate Activity 1.55</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="veryactive" value="veryactive">
<label for="veryactive">Very Active 1.75</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="extremely" value="extremely">
<label for="extremely">Extremely Active 1.95</label>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Your TDEE with Activity Multiple = <span name="tdee"></span></div>
<p></p>
<H2>How to get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender </span> % bf</H2>
With your current weight of <span name="weightInsert">X</span> and your current bf % of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span> you have <span id="leanInsert">Z</span> lbs of lean body mass and <span id="fatInsert">A</span> lbs of body fat. 
<p></p>
To get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf, you need to lose <span id="loseInsert">B</span> lbs of fat. 

Then you will have <span id="newFatInsert">C</span> lbs of fat, and <span id="newTotalBodyWeightInsert"></span> of total body weight, for a body fat % of <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf.
<div></div>

<div>
	Pick your caloric deficit:

	<button type="button" class="squareButton" id="reCalcButton">Re-calculate</button>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Your TDEE of <span name="tdee">X</span> minus your deficit of <span name="userPickedDeficitInsert">Y</span> gives you <span name="calorieBudgetInsert">Z</span> calories a day. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Your caloric deficit is <span id="percentDeficitInsert">not calculated</span>%. General advice is to pick a 25% deficit. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Eating <span name="calorieBudgetInsert">Z</span> calories a day, 
</div>
it will take you <span name="numberOfDaysTilGoalInsert">X</span> number of days to reach your goal.
<div>
	It will take you <span id="numberOfWeeksTilGoalInsert">X</span> number of weeks to reach your goal. 
</div>
<div>
	It will take you <span id="numberOfMonthsTilGoalInsert">X</span> number of months to reach your goal. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	It will be <span id="dateFromCalculatedDaysAway">daysinsert</span> in <span name="numberOfDaysTilGoalInsert">X</span> days. 
</div>
<div>
	There are <span id="daysTillSummerInsert">X</span> number of days until summer June 20, 2020 üèù. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	To lose fat and not muscle you need to workout lifting weights to remind your body you need the muscles. You need to eat enough protein to give the body fuel for building and maintaining muscles. And you need to sleep to allow your body to recover and keep your muscles. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Research shows that you need .82 grams of protein per pound of total body mass. 

	At <span name="weightInsert">X</span>lbs total body weight, you need <span id='gramsProteinInsert'></span> grams of protein a day.
