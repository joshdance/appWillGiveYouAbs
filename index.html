	<h2>How to estimate body fat percentage</h2>
	<p>There are many ways to estimate body fat, but one of the easiest and most straightforward ways is to just eyeball it with a comparison chart and descriptions.</p>
	<p>I scoured the internet for the best body fat comparison charts. Fair warning lots of pictures of people with various levels of body fat ahead. You don't have to be exactly accurate. Be honest. Guys usually think they are leaner than they really are, girls the opposite.</p>
	<h3>Body Fat Level Examples</h3>
	<p>I have scoured the internet looking for all the best real life examples of body fat percentages. Sources in the footnote section. <a href="bodyfatpercentageexamples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> or click the image to open full size in a new tab.</p>

<h2>What is your goal?</h2>
<p>
	What is your goal body fat %? This is a better question that what is your goal weight.
</p>
<div>
	<input type="number" class="inputform" id="bfGoalInputBox" value="10">
</div>

<h2>Starting Point</h2>
<div>
	You currently weigh <span name="weightInsert">A</span>lbs. With your current body fat percentage of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span>% you have <span id="LbsBfResultsDiv">B</span> of body fat and <span id="leanResultsDiv"></span> lbs of lean body mass.
</div>

<div>You want to decrease your body fat, and keep your lean body mass.</div>
<div>To do that, you need to do </div>
<ol>
	<li>Be in an energy deficit.</li>
	<li>Lift weights.</li>
	<li>Eat enough protein to repair and build your muscles.</li>
	<li>Sleep enough to repair and build your muscles and keep you stress hormones down..</li>
</ol>

<div id="bfRunDown"></div>
<div>Let's tackle the first one.</div>

<h2>Energy Deficit</h2>
<div>This one is a simple concept, but difficult to do. You need to balance how much energy you consume, with home much energy you use.</div>
<div>The energy you use needs to be consistently greater than the energy you consume.</div>

<div>Let's first calculate how much energy you use on average. </div>

<div>Your body uses or burns energy all the time to keep you alive and happy. If you did absolutely nothing in a day, your body would still burn a lot of energy keeping you healthy.</div>
<div>This is called your base metabolic rate, or BMR.</div>

<h3>Let's Calculate your BMR</h3>

<p>
<div>
	What is your age?
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="age" id="age" value="33">
</div>
<div>
	What is your height in feet?
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="feet" id="feet" value="5">
	and your remaining height in inches
	<input type="number" class="inputform" name="inches" id="inches" value="8">
</div>

<div>
	Let's use our weight, that you entered earlier, of <span name="weightInsert">weight fill</span>lbs.
</div>


<div>
	<button type="button" class="calcBmrButton squareButton" id="calcBmr">Calculate your BMR!</button>
</div>
<p></p>

<div>Your estimated BMR is <span id="bmrAnswer"></span></div>
<p></p>
<div>If you did nothing in a day, you body would burn that many calories keeping you alive. </div>
<div>
	However, we all do activites during the day. We multiple this BMR by an activity multipler to add in additional calories that we burn with our activity. 
</div>
<div>
<h3>Activity Multiplier</h3>

<div>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="sedentary" value="sedentary" checked>
<label for="sedentary">Sedentary 1.15</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="light" value="light">

	<h2>How to estimate your Activity Level</h2>
	<p>Studies have shown that we all overestimate how much we are active. So read the descriptions, pick where you think you are, then move down one level. For example if you think you are Moderately Active, chose Lightly Active. Since it is an estimate it just needs to be close and then you can see what the results are and tweak it. </p>

	<h4>Sedentary 1.15</h4>
	<p>You don‚Äôt intentionally exercise at all. Get up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, relax.</p>

	<h4>Lightly Active 1.2</h4>
	<p>On average, you walk for exercise about 30 minutes a day. Or you are running or lifting weights fro 15 minutes a day.</p>

	<h4>Moderately Active 1.4</h4>
	<p>If I was looking for you on a weeknight, I would call the gym. 50 minutes of vigorous exercise a day. Or about one hour and 45 minutes of walking (for exercise, not going around your house) per day. Most people do not do this.</p>

	<h4>Very Active 1.6</h4>
	<p>You move vigorously for your work (think something like construction or yardwork), or you workout every single day for more than an hour. If you were to get this level of activity only walking, it would be a nearly impossible four hours and 15 minutes of walking (again, for intentional exercise) a day.

	<h4>Extra Active 1.8</h4>
	<p>Hey there Michael Phelps. Almost no one does this. This means every single day you are working out hard for an hour and a half. Or you are a professional speed walker. </p>

<h2>How to get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender </span> % bf</h2>

With your current weight of <span name="weightInsert">X</span> and your current bf % of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span> you have <span id="leanInsert">Z</span> lbs of lean body mass and <span id="fatInsert">A</span> lbs of body fat. 
<p></p>
To get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf, you need to lose <span id="loseInsert">B</span> lbs of fat. 

Then you will have <span id="newFatInsert">C</span> lbs of fat, and <span id="newTotalBodyWeightInsert"></span> of total body weight, for a body fat % of <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf.

<div>
	Your caloric deficit is <span id="percentDeficitInsert">not calculated</span>%. General advice is to pick a 25% deficit.

it will take you <span name="numberOfDaysTilGoalInsert">X</span> number of days to reach your goal.
<div>
	It will take you <span id="numberOfWeeksTilGoalInsert">X</span> number of weeks to reach your goal.

<div>
	To lose fat and not muscle you need to workout lifting weights to remind your body you need the muscles. You need to eat enough protein to give the body fuel for building and maintaining muscles. And you need to sleep to allow your body to recover and keep your muscles. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Research shows that you need .82 grams of protein per pound of total body mass. 

	At <span name="weightInsert">X</span>lbs total body weight, you need <span id='gramsProteinInsert'></span> grams of protein a day.
