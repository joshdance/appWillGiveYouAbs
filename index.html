<h2>What is your goal?</h2>
<div>What is your goal body fat %? This is a better question that what is your goal weight.</div>
<div>
	<input type="number" id="bfGoalInputBox" value="10">
</div>

<h2>Starting Point</h2>
<div>
	You currently weight <span name="weightInsert">A</span>lbs. With your current body fat percentage of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span>% you have <span id="LbsBfResultsDiv">B</span> of body fat and <span id="leanResultsDiv"></span> lbs of lean body mass.
</div>

<div>You want to decrease your body fat, and keep your lean body mass.</div>
<div>To do that, you need to do </div>
<ol>
	<li>Be in an energy deficit.</li>
	<li>Lift weights.</li>
	<li>Eat enough protein to repair and build your muscles.</li>
	<li>Sleep enough to repair and build your muscles and keep you stress hormones down..</li>
</ol>

<div id="bfRunDown"></div>
<div>Let's tackle the first one.</div>

<h2>Energy Deficit</h2>
<div>This one is a simple concept, but difficult to do. You need to balance how much energy you consume, with home much energy you use.</div>
<div>The energy you use needs to be consistently greater than the energy you consume.</div>

<div>Let's first calculate how much energy you use on average. </div>

<div>Your body uses or burns energy all the time to keep you alive and happy. If you did absolutely nothing in a day, your body would still burn a lot of energy keeping you healthy.</div>
<div>This is called your base metabolic rate, or BMR.</div>

<h3>Let's Calculate your BMR</h3>

<p>
<div>
	What is your age?
	<input type="number" name="age" id="age" value="33">
</div>
<div>
	What is your height in feet?
	<input type="number" name="feet" id="feet" value="5">
	and your remaining height in inches
	<input type="number" name="inches" id="inches" value="8">
</div>

<div>
	What is your weight in lbs?
	<input type="number" name="weight" id="weight" value="180">
</div>


<div>
	<button type="button" class="calcBmrButton" id="calcBmr">Calculate your BMR!</button>
</div>
<p></p>

<div>Your estimated BMR is <span id="bmrAnswer"></span></div>
<p></p>
<div>If you did nothing in a day, you body would burn that many calories keeping you alive. </div>
<div>
	However, we all do activites during the day. We multiple this BMR by an activity multipler to add in additional calories that we burn with our activity. 
</div>
<div>
<h3>Activity Multiplier</h3>
</div>
<div>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="sedentary" value="sedentary" checked>
<label for="sedentary">Sedentary 1.15</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="light" value="light">
<label for="light">Light Activity 1.35</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="moderate" value="moderate">
<label for="moderate">Moderate Activity 1.55</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="veryactive" value="veryactive">
<label for="veryactive">Very Active 1.75</label>
<input type="radio" class="activity" name="activity" id="extremely" value="extremely">
<label for="extremely">Extremely Active 1.95</label>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Your TDEE with Activity Multiple = <span name="tdee"></span></div>
<p></p>
<H2>How to get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender </span> % bf</H2>
With your current weight of <span name="weightInsert">X</span> and your current bf % of <span name="bfInsert">Y</span> you have <span id="leanInsert">Z</span> lbs of lean body mass and <span id="fatInsert">A</span> lbs of body fat. 
<p></p>
To get to <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf, you need to lose <span id="loseInsert">B</span> lbs of fat. 

Then you will have <span id="newFatInsert">C</span> lbs of fat, and <span id="newTotalBodyWeightInsert"></span> of total body weight, for a body fat % of <span name="bfPercentGenderInsert">gender</span> % bf.

<div>
	Your TDEE of <span name="tdee">X</span> minus your deficit of <span name="userPickedDeficitInsert">Y</span> gives you <span name="calorieBudgetInsert">Z</span> calories a day. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
	Your caloric deficit is <span id="percentDeficitInsert">not calculated</span>%. General advice is to pick a 25% deficit.

	To lose fat and not muscle you need to workout lifting weights to remind your body you need the muscles. You need to eat enough protein to give the body fuel for building and maintaining muscles. And you need to sleep to allow your body to recover and keep your muscles. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
