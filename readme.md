To use this calculator live - https://thisappwillgiveyouabs.com/calculator

I believe that everyone can be healthy, happy, and in great physical shape. For a lot of people being in shape means having abs.

There too many half truths, falsehoods and mumbo jumbo thrown around as fitness advice. Everyone wants to sell you their program, supplement or secrets that make getting in shape easy. 

Getting in shape is not easy. But it is simple.

I have spent a lot of time researching and implmenting science based principles for getting in shape. 

This is a live essay + calculator that anyone can use to get abs, if they put the principles in practice and are consistent. 

"When level of intensity doesn't move the needle, consistency is where all the power comes from."
