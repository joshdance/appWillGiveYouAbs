I believe that everyone can be healthy, happy, and in great physical shape. 

There too many half truths, falsehoods and mumbo jumbo thrown around as fitness advice. Everyone wants to sell you their program, supplement or secrets that make getting in shape easy. 

It is not easy. But it is simple.

I have spent a lot of time researching and implmenting science based principles for getting in shape. 

This is a live essay + calculator that can get anyone abs, if they put the principles in practice and are consistent. 

"When level of intensity doesn't move the needle, consistency is where all the power comes from."

So far I have built 3 versions of the essay + calculator.

And a macros to calories calculator.

Create a table that will show projected progress over time. 

Make a 'how to get in shape by date' calculator.

add the ability to use the metric system (kg baby).

Create a login and account system so you don't have to type in your info each and every time.

refactor to have each function separate not a giant nest.
