I believe that everyone can be healthy, happy, and in great physical shape. 

There is way too much half truths, falsehoods and mumbo jumbo thrown around as fitness advice. 

I have spent a lot of time researching and implmenting science based principles for getting in shape. 

This is a live essay + calculator that can get anyone abs, if they put the principles in practice and are consistent. 

"When level of intensity doesn't move the needle, consistency is where all the power comes from."
