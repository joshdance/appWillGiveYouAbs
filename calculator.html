	<h2>How to estimate body fat percentage</h2>
	<p>
		There are many ways to estimate body fat, but one of the easiest and most straightforward ways is to just eyeball it with a comparison chart and descriptions.
	</p>
	<p>
		I scoured the internet for the best body fat comparison charts. Fair warning lots of pictures of people with various levels of body fat ahead. You don't have to be exactly accurate. Be honest. Guys usually think they are leaner than they really are, girls the opposite.
	</p>
	<h3>Body Fat Level Examples</h3>

		I have scoured the internet looking for all the best real life examples of body fat percentages. Sources in the footnote section. <a href="bodyfatpercentageexamples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> or click the image to open full size in a new tab.

<h2>What is your goal?</h2>
<div>
	What is your goal body fat %? This is a better question that what is your goal weight. Remember for <span class="gender">males</span> your abs pop at <span class="genderOptimalBfGoal">10%</span> body fat %.

	<h2>How to estimate your Activity Level</h2>
	<p>
		Studies have shown that we all overestimate how much we are active. So read the descriptions, pick where you think you are, then move down one level. For example if you think you are Moderately Active, chose Lightly Active. Since it is an estimate it just needs to be close and then you can see what the results are and tweak it.
	</p>

	<h4>Sedentary 1.15</h4>
	<p>
		You don‚Äôt intentionally exercise at all. Get up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, relax.
	</p>

	<h4>Lightly Active 1.2</h4>
	<p>
		On average, you walk for exercise about 30 minutes a day. Or you are running or lifting weights fro 15 minutes a day.
	</p>

	<h4>Moderately Active 1.4</h4>
	<p>
		If I was looking for you on a weeknight, I would call the gym. 50 minutes of vigorous exercise a day. Or about one hour and 45 minutes of walking (for exercise, not going around your house) per day. Most people do not do this.
	</p>

	<h4>Very Active 1.6</h4>
	<p>
		You move vigorously for your work (think something like construction or yardwork), or you workout every single day for more than an hour. If you were to get this level of activity only walking, it would be a nearly impossible four hours and 15 minutes of walking (again, for intentional exercise) a day.
	</p>

	<h4>Extra Active 1.8</h4>
	<p>
		Hey there Michael Phelps. Almost no one does this. This means every single day you are working out hard for an hour and a half. Or you are a professional speed walker.
	</p>
